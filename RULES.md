**Rule 1 : Always push changes**

Because this environment is temporary, we should always commit and push our changes to the 
remote github repository at https://github.com/signebedi/labyrinth.git at the end of each
coding session.

**Rule 2: Ask for help if you need it**

One of the reasons we have a shared environment is so that we can try new things without
needing to worry about making mistakes. The whole point of this exercise is so that we 
can try new things and learn. So that means ya gotta ask for help when you don't know 
something...
